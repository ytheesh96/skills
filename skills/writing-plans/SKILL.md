# Writing Implementation Plans

## Durable Kanban handoff

When a plan needs durable work, the foreground uses one explicit `board` and
stable `tenant`, calls `kanban_create` once per task, and supplies `parents` or
uses `kanban_link`. State is read with `kanban_list` and `kanban_show`; human
decisions use `kanban_block` and `kanban_unblock`. Planning, graph mutation,
follow-ups, acceptance, and closure remain foreground-owned.

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the implementer has zero context for the codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need: which files to touch, complete code, testing commands, docs to check, how to verify. Give them bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Authorized local commits only.

For safety-sensitive or architecture-changing work, first use the relentless design interview pattern: ask one question at a time, lead with a recommended answer, inspect the codebase instead of asking when possible, resolve dependency branches in order, then synthesize locked decisions into Kanban-ready root/child tasks. See `references/relentless-design-interview-to-kanban.md`.

Assume the implementer is a skilled developer but knows almost nothing about the toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Core principle:** A good plan makes implementation obvious. If someone has to guess, the plan is incomplete.

## When to Use

**Always use before:**
- Implementing multi-step features
- Breaking down complex requirements
- Delegating to subagents via subagent-driven-development

**Don't skip when:**
- Feature seems simple (assumptions cause bugs)
- You plan to implement it yourself (future you needs guidance)
- Working alone (documentation matters)

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each task = 2-5 minutes of focused work.**

## Model Vertical Slices and Dependencies

Prefer a **tracer bullet**: one narrow, complete path through every layer needed
to deliver observable behavior. Each task should be independently demoable or
verifiable, fit a fresh execution context, and carry explicit acceptance
criteria.

Represent prerequisites as a **blocking edge**, not prose buried in a task.
Tasks with no unresolved blockers form the **execution frontier** and may run in
parallel. For a durable Hermes Loop graph, map prerequisites to `depends_on`;
use `blocks` only when inserting new prerequisite work ahead of an existing
downstream task.

Wide mechanical refactors are the exception. Use
**expand–migrate–contract**: add the new form beside the old, migrate callers in
green batches, then remove the old form after every migration completes. Model
the expand, each migration, and the contract step as separate dependency nodes.

Every step is one action:
- "Write the failing test" — step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" — step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" — step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" — step
- "Commit when authorized" — step

**Too big:**
```markdown
### Task 1: Build authentication system
[50 lines of code across 5 files]
```

**Right size:**
```markdown
### Task 1: Create User model with email field
[10 lines, 1 file]

### Task 2: Add password hash field to User
[8 lines, 1 file]

### Task 3: Create password hashing utility
[15 lines, 1 file]
```

## Plan Document Structure

### Header (Required)

Every plan MUST start with:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Hermes:** Use subagent-driven-development skill to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---
```

### Task Structure

Each task follows this format:

````markdown
### Task N: [Descriptive Name]

**Objective:** What this task accomplishes (one sentence)

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/new_file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:45-67` (line numbers if known)
- Test: `tests/path/to/test_file.py`

**Step 1: Write failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify failure**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_specific_behavior -v`
Expected: FAIL — "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify pass**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_specific_behavior -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit (only when authorized)**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Understand Requirements

Read and understand:
- Feature requirements
- Design documents or user description
- Acceptance criteria
- Constraints

### Step 2: Explore the Codebase

Use Hermes tools to understand the project:

```python
# Understand project structure
search_files("*.py", target="files", path="src/")

# Look at similar features
search_files("similar_pattern", path="src/", file_glob="*.py")

# Check existing tests
search_files("*.py", target="files", path="tests/")

# Read key files
read_file("src/app.py")
```

### Step 3: Design Approach

Decide:
- Architecture pattern
- File organization
- Dependencies needed
- Testing strategy

### Step 4: Write Tasks

Create tasks around user-visible vertical slices:
1. First tracer-bullet behavior (TDD through every required layer)
2. Additional vertical behaviors
3. Edge cases attached to the seam they exercise
4. Integration and migration slices
5. Cleanup/documentation after behavior is green

For every task, record explicit `blocked by` edges and identify the initial
execution frontier. Use expand–migrate–contract nodes instead of pretending a
wide mechanical refactor is a single vertical slice.

### Step 5: Add Complete Details

For each task, include:
- **Exact file paths** (not "the config file" but `src/config/settings.py`)
- **Complete code examples** (not "add validation" but the actual code)
- **Exact commands** with expected output
- **Verification steps** that prove the task works

### Step 6: Review the Plan

Check:
- [ ] Tasks are sequential and logical
- [ ] Each task is bite-sized (2-5 min)
- [ ] File paths are exact
- [ ] Code examples are complete (copy-pasteable)
- [ ] Commands are exact with expected output
- [ ] No missing context
- [ ] Every task is a vertical behavior or justified refactor phase
- [ ] Blocking edges and the execution frontier are explicit
- [ ] Wide migrations use expand–migrate–contract
- [ ] DRY, YAGNI, TDD principles applied

### Step 7: Save the Plan

Save the plan only to the user-approved workspace path, normally
`docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`. Writing the plan does not authorize a
branch, commit, push, tracker issue, label change, or publication. Include a
local commit step only when the user explicitly authorized one, and stage only
the plan path.

## Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**Bad:** Copy-paste validation in 3 places
**Good:** Extract validation function, use everywhere

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

**Bad:** Add "flexibility" for future requirements
**Good:** Implement only what's needed now

```python
# Bad — YAGNI violation
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.preferences = {}  # Not needed yet!
        self.metadata = {}     # Not needed yet!

# Good — YAGNI
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
```

### TDD (Test-Driven Development)

Every task that produces code should include the full TDD cycle:
1. Write failing test
2. Run to verify failure
3. Write minimal code
4. Run to verify pass

See `test-driven-development` skill for details.

### Commit Policy

When the user authorized local commits, add a commit step after each
independently verified task and stage only that task's paths:
```bash
git add [files]
git commit -m "type: description"
```

Otherwise omit commit steps. Never add push, publication, branch, issue-write,
or label-change steps without explicit authorization.

## Common Mistakes

### Vague Tasks

**Bad:** "Add authentication"
**Good:** "Create User model with email and password_hash fields"

### Incomplete Code

**Bad:** "Step 1: Add validation function"
**Good:** "Step 1: Add validation function" followed by the complete function code

### Missing Verification

**Bad:** "Step 3: Test it works"
**Good:** "Step 3: Run `pytest tests/test_auth.py -v`, expected: 3 passed"

### Missing File Paths

**Bad:** "Create the model file"
**Good:** "Create: `src/models/user.py`"

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer the execution approach:

**"Plan complete and saved. Ready to execute using subagent-driven-development — I'll dispatch a fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance then code quality). Shall I proceed?"**

When executing, use the `subagent-driven-development` skill:
- Fresh `delegate_task` per task with full context
- Spec compliance review after each task
- Code quality review after spec passes
- Proceed only when both reviews approve

## Remember

```
Bite-sized tasks (2-5 min each)
Exact file paths
Complete code (copy-pasteable)
Exact commands with expected output
Verification steps
DRY, YAGNI, TDD
Authorized local commits only
```

**A good plan makes implementation obvious.**
